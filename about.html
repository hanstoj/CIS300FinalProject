        <p>Hello! I am a recent graduate of Hackbright academy a full stack immersive bootcamp with an emphasis on Python and Javascript.<br> I first fell in love with computer science six years ago, I was suffering from severe POTS syndrome and could only walk about an hour a day. Always having a love for creating, I turned to the interenet, and found my first language, Java. I spent hours everyday teaching myself. I was very lucky to have a full recovery a year later.
            <br>
            <br>
            With my recovered ability, I found a new lust for life. I traveled solo backpacking to over 40 countries while I completed my degree in Psychology at Arizona State University.
            <br>
            <br>
            When the pandemic hit, for the first time I slowed down again. This helped me remember what I loved to turn to for creativity, programming. Since the start of the pandemic I have been programming every day and come to the realization that this is the field I am the happiest in.  </p>
